Tip toes into the final project 🏊‍♀️
150 min

As you already figured out, there are already a lot of moving pieces in that are involved in the an MLOps pipeline. That is why we want you to start as early as possible preparing your final project.

    Head to the final section in Julie and read about the final projects assignment
    Start working on it alone or with your group

With all the previous tutorials, you have now enough knowledge to:

    Imagine a basic pipeline
    Write basic code
    Stage some servers to production

Tips 👋

    Your instructors / TAs should be able to guide in building your architecture, leverage this precious help
    Start with a piece of paper (even if it's digital). Don't go building right off the bat
    It's your future role to decide what architecture is best for a given purpose. However there are no 100% perfect solutions. Don't be a perfectionist
    The more you actually try building the infrastructure, the better it will be. Don't get stuck into "thinking" about the architecture. Piece of paper is good but at some point, get to your keyboard.

Happy developing 👩‍💻
